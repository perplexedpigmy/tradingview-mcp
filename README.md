# TradingView MCP

If you found this from the YouTube video — welcome. This is the improved fork. Everything you need is below.

Built on top of the original [tradingview-mcp](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp) by [@tradesdontlie](https://github.com/tradesdontlie). Full credit to them for the foundation. This fork adds a morning brief workflow, a rules config, and fixes the launch bug on TradingView Desktop v2.14+.

> [!WARNING]
> **Not affiliated with TradingView Inc. or Anthropic.** This tool connects to your locally running TradingView Desktop app via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Review the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) before use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Requires a valid TradingView subscription.** This tool does not bypass any TradingView paywall. It reads from and controls the TradingView Desktop app already running on your machine.

> [!NOTE]
> **All data processing happens locally.** Nothing is sent anywhere. No TradingView data leaves your machine.

## What's New in This Fork

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `morning_brief` | One command that scans your watchlist, reads all your indicators, and returns structured data for OpenCode to generate your session bias |
| `session_save` / `session_get` | Saves your daily brief to `.sessions/` directory within the project so you can compare today vs yesterday |
| Multiple rule files | Support for different rule files in `rules/` directory — each with its own assets and criteria |
| Launch bug fix | Fixed `tv_launch` compatibility with TradingView Desktop v2.14+ |
| `tv brief` CLI | Run your morning brief from the terminal in one word |

---

## One-Shot Setup

Paste this into OpenCode and it will handle everything:

```
Set up TradingView MCP for me — it's self-contained with no global installs.
Clone https://github.com/perplexedpigmy/tradingview-mcp.git to ~/tradingview-mcp, run npm install.
The project already has opencode.json with MCP config — OpenCode will auto-discover it.
Copy rules/rules.example.json to rules/rules.json so I can fill in my trading rules.
Verify with tv_health_check.
```

Or follow the manual steps below.

---

## Prerequisites

- **TradingView Desktop app** (paid subscription required for real-time data)
- **Node.js 18+**
- **OpenCode** (for MCP tools) or any terminal (for CLI)
- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**

---

## Project is Self-Contained

Everything you need is in this project. No global installs or global config changes.

- **Dependencies** — `npm install` installs packages into the project (`node_modules/`), not globally
- **MCP config** — Project's `opencode.json` is auto-discovered by OpenCode when you open this project
- **Skills** — Located in `.opencode/skills/` in this project, no global skills setup needed
- **Rules** — Your rule files stay in `rules/` directory within the project
- **Sessions** — Saved briefs are stored in `.sessions/` directory within the project

Nothing gets written to `~/.config/opencode/` or anywhere else on your system. Clone, install, and you're ready.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/perplexedpigmy/tradingview-mcp.git ~/tradingview-mcp
cd ~/tradingview-mcp
npm install
```

### 2. Set up your rules

```bash
cp rules/rules.example.json rules/rules.json
```

Open `rules/rules.json` and fill in:
- Your **watchlist** (symbols to scan each morning)
- Your **bias criteria** (what makes something bullish/bearish/neutral for you)
- Your **risk rules** (the rules you want OpenCode to check before every session)

### 3. Launch TradingView with CDP

TradingView must be running with the debug port enabled.

**Mac:**
```bash
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_mac.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
scripts\launch_tv_debug.bat
```

**Linux:**
```bash
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_linux.sh
```

Or use the MCP tool after setup: `"Use tv_launch to start TradingView in debug mode"`

### 4. OpenCode Auto-Discovers MCP

This project includes `opencode.json` at the root. When OpenCode opens this project, it automatically discovers and starts the TradingView MCP server.

For global MCP config (all projects), add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "tradingview": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["node", "/PATH/TO/tradingview-mcp/src/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/PATH/TO/tradingview-mcp` with your actual install path.

### 5. Verify

Ask OpenCode: *"Use tv_health_check to verify TradingView is connected"*

### 6. Run your first morning brief

Ask OpenCode: *"Run morning_brief and give me my session bias"*

Or from the terminal:
```bash
npm link  # install tv CLI globally (one time)
tv brief
```

---

## Justfile Operations

This project includes a `.justfile` for convenient commands:

```bash
just              # list all available tasks (default)
just on           # launch TradingView (auto-detects Linux/Mac/Windows)
just status       # check CDP connection status
```

The `on` task automatically selects the correct launch script based on your platform.

**Note:** You can also use the manual launch scripts as documented above.

---

## Morning Brief Workflow

This is the feature that turns this from a toolkit into a daily habit.

**Before every session:**

1. TradingView is open (launched with debug port)
2. Run: `tv brief` in your terminal (or ask OpenCode: *"run morning_brief"*)
3. OpenCode scans every symbol in your watchlist, reads your indicator values, applies your rules file criteria, and prints:

```
BTCUSD  | BIAS: Bearish  | KEY LEVEL: 94,200  | WATCH: RSI crossing 50 on 4H
ETHUSD  | BIAS: Neutral  | KEY LEVEL: 3,180   | WATCH: Ribbon direction on daily
SOLUSD  | BIAS: Bullish  | KEY LEVEL: 178.50  | WATCH: Hold above 20 EMA

Overall: Cautious session. BTC leading bearish, SOL the exception — watch for divergence.
```

4. Save it: *"save this brief"* (uses `session_save`)
5. Next morning, compare: *"get yesterday's session"* (uses `session_get`)

### Multiple Rule Files

You can create multiple rule files for different asset classes or strategies:

- Place rule files in the `rules/` directory (e.g., `rules/crypto.json`, `rules/forex.json`)
- Each rule file can have its own watchlist, bias criteria, and risk rules
- When saving sessions, specify which rule file to use — sessions are saved per rule file
- This lets you run morning briefs for different markets and keep them organized separately

---

## What This Tool Does

- **Morning brief** — scan watchlist, read indicators, apply your rules, print session bias
- **Pine Script development** — write, inject, compile, debug scripts with AI
- **Chart navigation** — change symbols, timeframes, zoom to dates, add/remove indicators
- **Visual analysis** — read indicator values, price levels, drawn levels from custom indicators
- **Draw on charts** — trend lines, horizontal levels, rectangles, text
- **Manage alerts** — create, list, delete price alerts
- **Replay practice** — step through historical bars, practice entries and exits with P&L tracking
- **Screenshots** — capture chart state
- **Multi-pane layouts** — 2x2, 3x1 grids with different symbols per pane
- **Stream data** — JSONL output from your live chart for monitoring scripts
- **CLI access** — every tool is also a `tv` command, pipe-friendly JSON output

## How OpenCode Knows Which Tool to Use

OpenCode reads `AGENTS.md` automatically when working in this project. It contains the full decision tree.

| You say... | OpenCode uses... |
|------------|---------------|
| "Run my morning brief" | `morning_brief` → apply rules → `session_save` |
| "What was my bias yesterday?" | `session_get` |
| "What's on my chart?" | `chart_get_state` → `data_get_study_values` → `quote_get` |
| "Give me a full analysis" | `quote_get` → `data_get_study_values` → `data_get_pine_lines` → `data_get_pine_labels` → `capture_screenshot` |
| "Switch to BTCUSD daily" | `chart_set_symbol` → `chart_set_timeframe` |
| "Write a Pine Script for..." | `pine_set_source` → `pine_smart_compile` → `pine_get_errors` |
| "Start replay at March 1st" | `replay_start` → `replay_step` → `replay_trade` |
| "Set up a 4-chart grid" | `pane_set_layout` → `pane_set_symbol` |
| "Draw a level at 94200" | `draw_shape` (horizontal_line) |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `cdp_connected: false` | TradingView isn't running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`. Use the launch script. |
| `ECONNREFUSED` | TradingView isn't running or port 9222 is blocked |
| MCP server not showing in OpenCode | Check `opencode.json` syntax |
| `tv` command not found | Run `npm link` from the project directory |
| `morning_brief` — "No rules found" | Ensure you have a rule file in `rules/` directory |
| `morning_brief` — watchlist empty | Add symbols to the `watchlist` array in your rule file |
| Tools return stale data | TradingView still loading — wait a few seconds |
| Pine Editor tools fail | Open Pine Editor panel first: `ui_open_panel pine-editor open` |

---

## Architecture

```
OpenCode  ←→  MCP Server (stdio)  ←→  CDP (port 9222)  ←→  TradingView Desktop (Electron)
```

- **78 original tools** + **3 morning brief tools** = 81 MCP tools total
- **Transport**: MCP over stdio + CLI (`tv` command)
- **Connection**: Chrome DevTools Protocol on localhost:9222
- **No external network calls** — everything runs locally
- **Zero extra dependencies** beyond the original
